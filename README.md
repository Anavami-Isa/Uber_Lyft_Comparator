# Uber_Lyft_Comparator
App that combines the Uber and Lyft apps and compares their prices and times using user data. This allows for the user to efficiently decide whether to use Lyft or Uber in a given situation.

This app was built using React Native and javascript and can be run using Expo. Recieves ride data [estimated cost, ride type, pickup/destination location, estimated ride time, driver name?] through the Uber(guest trips) and Lyft APIs

Currently does not have approval from Lyft API, so cannot order rides through Lyft
